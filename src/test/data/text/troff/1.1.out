       The SIZE argument is an integer and  optional  unit  (example:  10K  is
       10*1024).   Units  are  K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y  (powers  of 1024) or KB,MB,...
       (powers of 1000).

       The TIME_STYLE argument can be  full-iso,  long-iso,  iso,  locale,  or
       +FORMAT.   FORMAT  is  interpreted  like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FOR-
       MAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FOR-
       MAT2  to  recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect
       only outside the POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE  environment  vari-
       able sets the default style to use.

       Using  color  to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
       with [1m--color[22m=[4mnever[24m.  With [1m--color[22m=[4mauto[24m, ls emits color codes only  when
       standard  output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
       variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   [1mExit status:[0m
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).
